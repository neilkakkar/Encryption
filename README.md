# Encryption
A simple encrypter and decrypter for sending and recieving coded messages.

Running Instructions:
1)Simply copy all files , extract to a location and run the makefile.

2)Enter command :encrypt in the command window (which is name of the executable) to encrypt text.

  2.5) The output of the text is stored in a file called "ciphertext.txt" in the same folder

3)Enter command :decrypt in the command window (which is name of the executable) to decrypt given text.

  3.5) The decrypter takes input as the text file, "ciphertext.txt"


**Currently, only input texts with no spaces are supported. (To be provided soon)

**Organisation of files into different folders(include, src etc) to be done as soon as I figure out how to use the makefile for such a purpose.

The marker is a keygen, used to generate the key to be used for encryption or decryption. The sender and reciever must have the same marker key to decode the messages.
